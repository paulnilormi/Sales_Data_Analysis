# Sales_Data_Analysis
🛒 Sales Data Analysis Project
Welcome to the Sales Data Analysis project! 📊 This project dives deep into a simulated product sales dataset using powerful Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. It’s a great showcase of real-world data analytics—perfect for aspiring data analysts and enthusiasts!

📌 Project Overview
This project explores a dataset containing 100 rows of sales data for various products across multiple regions and stores. The aim is to derive meaningful business insights such as:

🔍 Which store generates the highest sales?

🛍️ Which product performs the best?

🌍 How sales differ across regions?

📅 How do monthly trends reflect sales performance?

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
Python

Pandas – for data cleaning and manipulation

NumPy – for numerical operations

Matplotlib – for clear and impactful visualizations

📈 Key Analysis Performed
✔️ Converted date column to datetime format for time-based analysis
✔️ Added synthetic Unit_price and Store columns for more detailed breakdown
✔️ Created Total_sales column for aggregations
✔️ Performed group-by analysis on:

Stores

Products

Regions

Months

✔️ Visualized:

🔸 Total Sales by Store (Bar Chart)

🔹 Total Sales by Product (Bar Chart)

🟢 Sales Distribution by Region (Pie Chart)

📊 Sample Insights
Store_A outperformed others with the highest total revenue.

Certain products significantly contribute to total sales.

Sales distribution varies widely across different regions.

Sales show seasonal/monthly variations, important for strategic planning.
